Finding out what GitHub is about

In a galaxy far far away...
I've started learning coding again
Day 1
This is me testing the way github works, branching, merging, pulling and so on

Day 2
Okay, I'm frustrated now

Day three, think I've got the hang of this (didn't got that much time to look into it that's why it takes so much)
Hope it works...
